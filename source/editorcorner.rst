Editor's note
=============

The LOFAR imaging cookbook is intended to be a comprehensive guide for astronomers who make use of LOFAR's interferometric observing mode. This cookbook documents the commonly used software packages that are used to calibrate and image LOFAR data.

The LOFAR imaging cookbook is currently edited by `Sarrvesh Sridhar <mailto:sarrvesh@astron.nl>`_ with contributions to individual chapters by a number of LOFAR users. If you would us to add a new feature to this cookbook or have ideas about improving the documentation, please contact `Sarrvesh Sridhar <mailto:sarrvesh@astron.nl>`_ and/or the `Radio Observatory <mailto:sos@astron.nl>`_.
